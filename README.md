# Eth dev template

Backend may not be necessary.
Contracts = solidity + hardhat + typescript.
Frontend = next + tailwind + ethers (+vercel).

All files named with `.page.js` under `frontend/pages` will be treated as pages.
All files named with `.api.js` under `frontend/pages/api` will be treated as stateless api endpoints (like aws lambda).

Remember to `npm install`.
